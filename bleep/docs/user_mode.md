# User mode (coming soon)

User mode will offer a **streamlined, opinionated workflow** aimed at field technicians and penetration testers who need quick answers without wading through every low-level detail.

Planned features:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Device discovery wizard | ðŸŸ¡ in development |
| One-click GATT dump + HTML report | ðŸŸ¡ in development |
| Simplified notification listener | ðŸŸ¡ in development |
| Asset-of-Interest (AoI) checklist integration | ðŸ”œ planned |

## Expected invocation

```bash
python -m bleep user   # alias for "-m interactive --profile user"
```

Until implementation lands you can achieve similar results via **interactive mode** with preloaded helper scripts â€“ see `scripts/examples/*`.
