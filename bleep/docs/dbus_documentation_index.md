# D-Bus Reliability Documentation Index

This document serves as a central reference for all documentation related to the D-Bus Reliability Framework implemented in BLEEP.

## Overview

The D-Bus Reliability Framework provides comprehensive tools and patterns for improving the reliability, robustness, and performance of BlueZ D-Bus operations. It addresses common issues such as hanging method calls, signal delivery problems, connection failures, and performance bottlenecks.

## Integration with BLEEP

The D-Bus Reliability Framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing BLEEP code. The primary integration points are:

1. **Timeout Enforcement**
   - Can be applied to any D-Bus method call via decorators or direct function calls
   - Works with any D-Bus interface, not just BlueZ

2. **Connection Pooling**
   - Can be used wherever D-Bus connections are needed
   - Especially useful for high-volume operations

3. **BlueZ Monitoring**
   - Can be integrated with any code that interacts with BlueZ services
   - Provides early warning for potential issues

4. **Metrics Collection**
   - Can be used to track performance of any operation, not just D-Bus calls
   - Helps identify bottlenecks and issues

## Usage Examples

### Basic Timeout Enforcement

```python
from bleep.dbus.timeout_manager import with_timeout

@with_timeout("connect", device_address="00:11:22:33:44:55")
def connect_device(device_interface):
    device_interface.Connect()
```

### Connection Pooling

```python
from bleep.dbus.connection_pool import connection_manager

with connection_manager() as bus:
    obj = bus.get_object("org.bluez", "/org/bluez/hci0")
    adapter = dbus.Interface(obj, "org.bluez.Adapter1")
    adapter.StartDiscovery()
```

### Recovery Strategies

```python
from bleep.dbuslayer.recovery import recover_connection

# When a connection fails
if not success:
    recover_connection(
        device_address,
        bus,
        device_path,
        adapter_path,
        device_interface
    )
```

### Metrics Collection

```python
from bleep.core.metrics import record_operation

# Record operation metrics
start_time = time.time()
success = False
try:
    # Perform operation
    success = True
except Exception:
    pass
elapsed = time.time() - start_time
record_operation("operation_name", elapsed, success)
```

## Conclusion

The D-Bus Reliability Framework significantly enhances the robustness of BLEEP's Bluetooth operations. By addressing common issues with D-Bus communication, it ensures more reliable connections, better error handling, and improved performance.
