"""Simple text-based interactive mode replacing legacy user_mode.

Current capabilities:
• scan – list nearby BLE devices (LE) with address & name
• connect <MAC> – connect + enumerate, then allow characteristic read/write via ble_ctf helper shortcuts
• quit – exit

The mode intentionally avoids complex menus; advanced features will be added
as needed.
